# SASPEECH: A Hebrew Single Speaker Dataset for Text To Speech and Voice Conversion

We present SASPEECH, a 30-hour single speaker Hebrew corpus accompanied by a text-to-speech (TTS) benchmark. It is the first large-scale high-quality open dataset of its kind. We believe our work will facilitate future generative Hebrew tools and low resource language research. The corpus will be publicly accessible at [https://www.openslr.org/134]. Code for the baseline TTS system will be available at [TODO]
